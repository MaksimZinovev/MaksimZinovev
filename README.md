### Hi there 👋

I am Max, software tester intern @Aerofiler.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of new things from #TestBash Home2021 presentations and talks.
- 👯 I’m looking to connect with anyone who is learning test automation and testing. Let's help each other.
- 💬 Ask me about podcasting or podcasts. I am a big fan and currently involved in production of 2 podcasts.
